# Welcome to my MAGD 150 portfolio

Here I am showcasing five different assignments in which I have created for my MAGD 150 class.

## Showcase
Here here are some of my assignments:

### [Assignment 1](https://github.com/RyanGrabBarb/MAGD-150-Portfolio/blob/gh-pages/s19magd150lab04_Brahm/s19magd150lab04_Brahm.pde) Titled: s19magd150lab04_Brahm
For this program, I attempted to make a whirlpool sort of effect, so I did just that with a series of many overlapping blue lines. I also made it so that one could change trhe speed of the whirlpool by using the arrow keys; since I used a randomizing function. one can also change the shape of the whirlpool if desired.

### [Assignment 2](https://github.com/RyanGrabBarb/MAGD-150-Portfolio/blob/gh-pages/s19magd150lab05_Brahm/s19magd150lab05_Brahm.pde) Titled: s19magd150lab05_Brahm
This assignment is comprised of many created shapes and use of movement with them. Upon running this program, one will be presented with a television with a button that turn the t.v. on and off. As well as that, there are buttons to change the speed of the endlessly created cars that show up on the t.v.

### [Assignment 3](https://github.com/RyanGrabBarb/MAGD-150-Portfolio/tree/gh-pages/s19magd150lab06_Brahm) Titled: s19magd150lab06_Brahm
This is a fairly simple falling rain animation like program. As well as that, theres a poem I just randomly thought of that will print upon for different lines while running the code.

### [Assignment 4](https://github.com/RyanGrabBarb/MAGD-150-Portfolio/blob/gh-pages/s19magd150_lab08_Brahm/s19magd150_lab08_Brahm.pde) Titled: s19magd150lab08_Brahm
This code creates two motivational sentences, but both sentences are ustilizing creepy fonts. I found doing this was ironic but kinda funny.

### [Assignment 5](https://github.com/RyanGrabBarb/MAGD-150-Portfolio/blob/gh-pages/s19magd150lab09_Brahm/s19magd150lab09_Brahm.pde) Titled: s19magd150lab09_Brahm
This progam consists of a slideshow documentary video in which I discovered on YouTube. Aside from that, an image of a frame that the video is played within is imported. Aside from both of those, a song for background music, that I have created mysrelf, was imported.
